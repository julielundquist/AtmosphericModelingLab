# AtmosphericModelingLab
This repo includes notebooks for the Atmospheric Modeling Lab at JHU for Spring 2026
## Written by Julie Lundquist, Julie.Lundquist@JHU.edu
It will be updated periodically through the semester
### Semester Plan
ICA01 - no notebook, just testing ncdump and globus for file transfer

ICA02 - notebook for making simple plots at either one timestamp or one height and many timestamps from the Hurricane Katrina example

ICA03 - idealized sea breezes and surface forcing

ICA04 - geogrid and map projections

ICA05 - initial and boundary conditions

ICA06 - real simulations including nesting

ICA07 - physics options (PBL parameterizations)

ICA08 - simulation sensitivity: adaptive timesteps, vertical resolution, domain size

ICA09 - no notebook / Spring Break!

ICA10 - cloud microphysics

ICA11 - specific parameterizations for applications: urban modeling, wind farm parameterizations 

ICA12 - large-eddy simulations with WRF

ICA13 - AI models and NWP

student\_work - this directory should be where student modifications of the notebooks should be to avoid conflicts with merges.
